# soil-plant-model
This model couples stomatal conductance, plant hydraulics, ABA production, and soil water balance to quantify 
(1) the hydraulic risk and (2) net cumulative carbon assimilation of a plant over a designated dry period.
It does not allow for xylem refilling. For more details of model implementation, please refer to: 

Feng et al. (2018), The ecohydrological context of drought and classification of plant responses, Ecology Letters.

This code was written in Python 2.7 and requires the Python packages numpy, scipy, matplotlib, and xlrd.
They can be downloaded through an Anaconda Distribution, which also includes the development environment Spyder.
