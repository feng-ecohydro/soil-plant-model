# soil-plant-model
This repository contains description of a model that couples stomatal conductance, plant hydraulics, ABA production, and soil water balance to quantify plant responses during a designated dry period. Specifically, the responses are quantified using: 
(1) hydraulic risk, and 
(2) net cumulative carbon assimilation. 
The model does not allow for xylem refilling. For more details of model implementation, please refer to: 

Feng et al. (2018), The ecohydrological context of drought and classification of plant responses, Ecology Letters.

This code was written in Python 2.7 and requires the Python packages numpy, scipy, matplotlib, and xlrd.
They can be downloaded through an Anaconda Distribution, which also includes the development environment Spyder. 
See: https://www.anaconda.com/download/ and https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/packages/pkg-docs.html (for a list of packages).
